Neuron DI complements dependency injection (DI) frameworks with lazy resolution 
and caching of dependencies.
It is based on the concept of decorating and implementing parameterless, 
possibly abstract methods at runtime.
It can also be used standalone if dependency binding is not required. 
It provides APIs for Java 8 and Scala 2.11.x or above.
