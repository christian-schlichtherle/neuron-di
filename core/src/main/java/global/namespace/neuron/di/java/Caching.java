/**
 * Indicates that a caching strategy should be applied to the return value of the annotated synapse method.
 * <p>
 * In compliance with the Java Language Specification, this annotation is not inherited, so if you override a method
 * with this annotation and you want to apply a caching strategy to the overriding method, you have to add this
 * annotation again.
 * In other words, if this annotation is not present on a synapse method, no caching strategy is applied to it.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be applied to custom annotation types, in which case any method annotated with these is
 * treated as if it's directly annotated with this annotation.
 * For example:
 * <pre><code>
 *     import global.namespace.neuron.di.java.*;
 *     import java.lang.annotation.*;
 *
 *     &#64;Caching(CachingStrategy.THREAD_LOCAL)
 *     &#64;Documented
 *     &#64;Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
 *     &#64;Target(ElementType.METHOD)
 *     public &#64;interface ThreadLocalCaching {
