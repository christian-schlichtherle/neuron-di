/**
 * Indicates that the annotated class or interface is a <i>neuron type</i>.
 * A neuron type is supposed to have <i>synapse methods</i> to make contact with its dependencies.
 * All abstract, parameterless methods in a neuron type are synapse methods - there is no need to declare them.
 * The {@link Incubator} implements these methods when <i>breeding</i> a neuron so that its dependencies are resolved
 * <i>lazily</i>, that is, no sooner as the neuron calls a synapse method.
 * In a nutshell, a neuron resolves all its dependencies lazily by calling its synapse methods, so they all have a name
 * and a type.
 * <p>
 * If this annotation is present on a class, it gets inherited by any subclass.
 * In compliance with the Java Language Specification, this does not apply to interfaces.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be applied to custom annotation types, in which case any class or interface annotated with
 * these is treated as if it's directly annotated with this annotation.
 * For example, the following annotation caches all synapse values using a thread-safe strategy:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     import global.namespace.neuron.di.java.*;
 *     import java.lang.annotation.*;
 *
 *     @Neuron(cachingStrategy = CachingStrategy.THREAD_SAFE)
 *     @Inherited
 *     @Documented
 *     @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
 *     @Target(ElementType.TYPE)
 *     public @interface ThreadSafeCachingNeuron {
 *     }
 * }</pre>
